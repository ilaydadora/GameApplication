 ✨ Game App Project is fundamentally listing games that are in the past and the latest ones. This app consists of;

✔️ Customized onboarding screen,
✔️ Game list page, you can search a specific game or show all of them by scrolling downward, 
✔️ Pagination, filtering 
✔️ MVC, 
✔️ Page view for the games in header, 
✔️ Coredata, 
✔️ You can mark as favourite whichever game you want and then you can see them in a collection view all listed in your library 
✔️ Displaying the detail view of the game when you click,
